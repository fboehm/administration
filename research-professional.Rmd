Use `vistime` R package to make a timeline, too!

## Research goals

1. Using TIMBR to infer allelic series
  a. TIMBR with simulated traits - how well do we recover allelic series?? When does TIMBR give unreasonable inferences? When does it give wrong (but maybe reasonable) inferences? 
  a. TIMBR with QTL in DO & CC  
1. Aim 2 of the F32 (use TIMBR for allelic series inferences)
  a. infer allelic series at QTLs in DO & reduced model QTL scan in CC
  a. infer allelic series at QTLs in CC & reduced model QTL scan in DO
  
1. F2 (CC001 by CC042)
  a. How to use QTL in these F2s to find QTL in DO and CC?

1. RNAseq data processing and analysis
  a. Get quantitative traits from FASTQ files
  a. QTL mapping for these quant traits
  a. Mediation analyses? Mediation with consideration of allelic series???
