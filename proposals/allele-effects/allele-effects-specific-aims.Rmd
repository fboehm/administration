## Specific Aim 1

Develop Bayesian methods for inferring allele number and allele effects at known quantitative trait loci.

We propose new strategies and methods for simultaneous inference of allele number and allele effects at quantitative trait loci in multiparental populations. We choose a Bayesian framework to provide a statistically rigorous implementation for our methods. 



## Specific Aim 2

Quantify enhancement in statistical power to detect quantitative trait loci in new cohorts of mice. 




## Specific Aim 3

Disseminate methods through open-source software and instructional materials. 

## Specific Aim 4

Enhance power to detect QTL in hotspots by first establishing the allele partitioning of the strongest traits. Then collapse genotypes according to that partitioning and scan all traits with collapsed genotypes.
