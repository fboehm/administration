## Specific Aim 1

Develop Bayesian methods for inferring allele number and allele effects at known quantitative trait loci.

We propose new strategies and methods for simultaneous inference of allele number and allele effects at quantitative trait loci in multiparental populations. We choose a Bayesian framework to provide a statistically rigorous implementation for our methods. 



## Specific Aim 2

Apply methods to quantify enhancement in statistical power to detect quantitative trait loci in new cohorts of mice. 

## Specific Aim 3

Disseminate methods through open-source software and instructional materials.
